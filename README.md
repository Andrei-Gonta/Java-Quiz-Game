### Quiz Game
This is my Quiz Game application made in Java! 
The project contains 3 important files:
1. Quiz.java -- where can be found the most of the code;
2. Main.java -- the filw that containt the main method;
3. Q_set -- this is the "database" file where the questions, answer options and correct answers are stored. This file can be modified in order to add or remove questions which makes the app dynamic.

The project has also an user interface created using JFrame, which displays the question number, question text, 4 buttons for the possible answers and a timer.
   
### DISCLAIMER
The project was inspired by one of Bro Code's videos. I wrote the code on my own and tried to build new specifications using the video as a starting point!
